# Single Server Simulation Project

This project simulates a single-server queueing system for educational purposes. It allows users to input simulation parameters via a web form, processes them, and calculates various metrics to analyze the system's performance.

## Demo

Check out the live demo [here](http://simulation.42web.io).

## How to Use

1. **Input Simulation Data:**
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser.
   - Enter the required parameters: number of customers, random variables, intervals, and probabilities.
   - Click on the "Simulate" button to submit the form.

2. **View Simulation Results:**
   - The results will be processed by `process.php`.
   - Navigate to `simulation-results.php` to view the detailed simulation table and metrics.
